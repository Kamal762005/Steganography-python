# Secure Data Hiding In Images Using Steganography.
  This Project Demonstrates A Simple Implementation Of Image Steganography Using Python and OpenCV. The Application Allows Users To Hide (Encrypt) A Secret Message Inside An Image And Retrieve (Decrypt) The Message From The Image. It Is Password Protected Message And The Password Is Stored With The Image.

### Features
* **Data Security** to hide sensitive information within innocuous files, making it difficult for unauthorized users to detect the presence of the hidden data.
* **Ease of Use** Effective steganographic methods should be user-friendly, allowing individuals to easily embed and extract hidden messages without requiring extensive technical knowledge.
* **Capacity** This refers to the amount of data that can be hidden within a cover medium (images). The capacity varies depending on the method used and the type of cover medium.
* **Low Detection Risk** The goal is to avoid detection, so the hidden message should not raise suspicion.

### Requirements
* platform - Any Platform That Support Python.
* Libraries - opencv, os, string.<br><br>
* Use The Following Command To Install opencv Through Terminal :<br>
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python
  ```

* Use The Following Command To Install Cryptography Package Through Terminal :<br>
  ```bash
  pip install pycryptodome
  ```

### Run the file Steganography.py :<br>
